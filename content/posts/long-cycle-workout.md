As I prepare for longer runs I've decided to incorporate long cycle workouts to build my aerobic capacity and endurance. <!--more-->



Using the 16kg kettlebell with 2 minute rests between the workouts


1. 4 minutes of kettlebell snatches 
2. 5 minutes of one arm swings 
3. 5 minutes of Squats and two arm swings
4. 5 minutes of 5 burpees and 5 snatches per arm.
