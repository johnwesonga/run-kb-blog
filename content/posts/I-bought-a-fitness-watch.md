I decided to buy myself (company paid for it as part of the wellness perk) a fitness watch

I don't particularly care for watches, I find them to be a distraction and something else I must take care of on a regular basis like a phone.

I can't do Kettlebell snatches or cleans with a watch on my wrist so that’s already a negative for me.

My youngest child will see it as another toy and I’ll spend a lot of time saying “No!Stop!”.

Having whined about this enough I selected a [Garmin VivoActive 4](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/643382), because it was on sale and so it fit my budget, plus everyone raves about Garmin fitness trackers.

Over the next few weeks I’m going to use it to track my activities, sleep, heart rate and oxygen levels when I sleep (I was diagnosed with sleep apnea a few years back so this info will help me).
