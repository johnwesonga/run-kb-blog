I managed to squeeze in a run today despite a few setbacks the last couple of days.

Last couple of days I've had some tenderness/pain in my right inner knee which has made me rethink my approach to running.

There are a couple of explanations to the cause of the pain but the most likely one is that my running form may not be optimized or that I'm overworking my body and I need to take it easy.

I warmed up for the run using Loaded beast, side kickthroughs, Ape and Squat for a few reps and then did my usual dynamic stretches.

I did a rather slow run, averaging about 12:30/km which is a minute above my normal pace of 11:30/km, but I was ok with it because I didn't want to aggravate the knee and I wanted a good pace that I could hold for a reasonable distance (5k+).
