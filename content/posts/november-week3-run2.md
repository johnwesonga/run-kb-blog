Today is a run day, my plan is to try and hit 6 miles as I prepare for my first 10k race.

Woke up at around 5am but didn’t get out of bed until around 6:30am.

Started with some stretches that I’d seen on the [GoWOD](https://www.gowod.app/) app, but to be honest I can’t do most of them but I put in the effort which is what matters.
