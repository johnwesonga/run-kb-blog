I did it, I ran my first 10k, actually it was 10.85km and it felt awesome!!

One thing I noticed is that at some point my body was almost in autopilot, I felt as though I could just run without stopping!!

I plan to run a [10K race](http://runwalnutcreek.com/) on December 11th but I was unsure whether I'd be able to pull it off. Now that I've completed one, it's given me the confidence to really do this!!
