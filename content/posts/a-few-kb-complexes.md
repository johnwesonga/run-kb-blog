My workout today was a bit of a mix of everything which basically means I did a bunch of complexes.

I warmed up first with some prying goblet squats, windmills, halos, round the world, squats and single leg deadlift.

**Workout #1** - Double Kettlebell (16kg) Ladder 1-3-5-7-10



1. Swings
2. Cleans
3. Squats

Rest for 3 minutes

**Workout #2** - Humane Burpee, ladder down the squats and pushups



1. 15 Swings
2. 5 Squats
3. 5 Pushups

Rest for 3 minutes

Workout #3 - Complex, start with one side and then switched to the other side



1. 5 offset push ups
2. 5 KB rows
3. 5 deadlifts
4. 5 rack squats
5. 5 overhead press

Rest for 3 minutes

Last and final workout was a long cycle snatch set which was basically 4 minutes of snatches with the 16kg.
