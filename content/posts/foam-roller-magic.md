I bought a foam roller a while back and barely used it up until this week when my right knee started giving me grief.

It turns out a strained/tight hamstring can impact the whole leg leading to pain in the knee. I decided to use the foam roller on my right hamstring and I worked that leg for about 5-10 minutes in bursts of 30-60 seconds.

By the time I was done, the tightness in my hamstring was gone, the soreness in my knee had subsided!!
