Stumbled upon a few Primal/Animal movements and decided to incorporate them as part of my active rest day as well as my strength and cardio workouts.

This morning I did 5 rounds/5 sets of the following workout:

Animal Flow Complex

5 Rounds - 5 Reps each

1 Rep =

- Contralateral Lift (opposite hand and foot) per side
- [Loaded Beast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXvcySEHSKw)
- [Side Kick Through per side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss2scMmgmNQ)
- Loaded Beast
- Squat

By the time I was done with this I was drenched in sweat.
