November has come to an end and I have to make some decisions on what I'll do next, but first a retrospective.

<!--more-->



**Lessons learned**
- I can run and I enjoy it.
- I can run 5k.
- I can run 10K.
- I shouldn't have tried to run the 10k in my first month of running even if I could do it.
- I have an injury on my right knee that's making running a bit challenging.
- I need to slow down and take it easy.

**Next Steps**
- December will be my conditioning month so I'll go back to doing the kettlebell on the 3-5 day schedule.
- I'll observe how my knee feels at the end of December.
- I'll most likely not run the 10K race in December.
- I'll focus on the 10k race in mid February, but that will depend on how my knee feels.

I feel bad that I have to stop running for a month, but I know I can pick it up again in January plus I want my knee to be healthy for all my activities and that won't happen if it's sore all the time.
